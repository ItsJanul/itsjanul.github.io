I spend a good amount of time on the programming Q+A site [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (and a smaller amount of time on its statistics sister site, [Cross Validated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)). Recently [this question on Meta Stack Overflow](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/251758) (the website's discussion forum) caught my attention, raising the question of whether Stack Overflow had become "more negative" recently. It wasn't the first time that I'd heard suggestions of this nature, but due to [recency bias](http://www.skepdic.com/recencybias.html) I'm cautious of turning a complaint ("I don't like X") into trends ("kids these days with their X"). In particular, the fact that people were noticing the [exact same "trend" in September 2008](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9953/could-we-please-be-a-bit-nicer-to-new-users) would appear to confirm that it's not a recent phenomenon.

But [this answer in particular struck me](http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/251842/712603), as it suggested a simple, specific and testable hypothesis regarding the supposed decline of Stack Overflow: that high-reputation users are starting to quit the site. ("Reputation" is a measure of trust within the Stack Overflow community achieved by receiving upvotes on your questions and answers, so high-reputation users are those who had answered many questions- a mass exodus of such users would indeed be worrisome). As the answer was provided by one of the most prolific answerers on Stack Overflow, it seemed like it deserved consideration.

Luckily, the Stack Exchange network has made an exceptional resource available to data scientists: the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer](https://data.stackexchange.com/), which lets anyone query information about the history of users and posts. So I constructed a dataset of the number of Stack Overflow answers per user per month since January 2012, for all users with reputation >= 20000, using [this query](http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/query/186926) [1].


{% highlight r %}
library(data.table)
answers.raw = as.data.table(read.csv("input/highrep_user_answers_per_month.csv"))

# We need to remove the current month (not over yet)
answers = answers.raw[!(Year == 2014 & Month == 12)]
answers$Date = as.Date(paste(answers$Year, answers$Month, 15, sep="-"))
answers$Count = as.numeric(answers$Count)
{% endhighlight %}
